- `FALSE`, `false` (case-insensitive), and `0` are all considered falsey
- `TRUE`, `true` (case-insensitive), and all nonzero numbers are considered truthy
- Other values produce an error when used in a place expecting a boolean

When used as a number, `TRUE` is equivalent to `1` and `FALSE` is equivalent to `0`.
